# fuchsia-html
This is the system UI of Fuchsia OS, recreated in HTML.  You can either download it and open the html file; but for the full experience, install it as a chrome app.

# How to use
Click the circle for the apps menu, click the clock for the settings menu, Click the G icon in the search bar to close the apps menu. I will try to add working applications tied to the icons in the apps launcher.
